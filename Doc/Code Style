Prefer enums instead of macros. If inevitable to use defines export them with LV_EXPORT_CONST_INT(defined_value) right after the define.
In function arguments prefer type name[] declaration for array parameters instead of type * name
Use typed pointers instead of void * pointers
Functions and structs which are not part of the public API must begin with underscore in order to mark them as "private".
Arguments must be named in H files too.
Use const whenever possible to avoid unintended modifications of objects.
Use static inline functions instead of macros whenever possible.
